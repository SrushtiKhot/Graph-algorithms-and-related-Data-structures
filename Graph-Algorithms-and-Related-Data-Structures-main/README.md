Coding part is done in 2 different .py files. As Minimum spanning tree and Shortest path topics are to be coded on both directed and undirected graphs, they are combined in a single code. Finding Strongly Connected components of a graph requires to check only on directed graphs, hence it is implemented in different code with different input text files that include directed graphs. Minimum Spanning Tree and Shortest Path - shortestpath_and_minspaningtree Strongly Connected Components- strongly_connected_comps
•	Input files used for Shortest Path and Minimum Spanning Tree are as follows:

The input text files contain alphabets as nodes starting from A. 

directed_1

directed_2

directed_3

undirected_1

undirected_2

undirected_3

•	Input files used for Strongly Connected Paths are as follows:

The input text files contain numbers only as nodes starting from 0.
